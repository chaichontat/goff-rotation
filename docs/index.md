This project repurposes the Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500 into an epifluorescence microscope with fluidics control. An overarching goal is to provide an accessible production-level software to control the HiSeq. The system could be controlled through a command line interface and a web interface.

PySeq 2501 is written in Python 3.10 but should also work with 3.9.

This repurposing project is possible thanks to the pioneering work of Pandit et al. for [`PySeq2500`](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.27.457864v1.full) ([GitHub](https://github.com/nygctech/PySeq2500)). Much of the technical details and breadcrumbs are available thanks to the [HiSeq2000 - Next Level Hacking](https://www.hackteria.org/wiki/HiSeq2000_-_Next_Level_Hacking) project from Urs Gaudenz and the [ReSeq](https://forum.hackteria.org/c/reseq/19) Hackteria team.
